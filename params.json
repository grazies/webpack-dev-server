This should be used for **development only**.\r\n\r\nIt uses [webpack-dev-middleware](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware) under the hood, which provides fast in-memory access to the webpack assets.\r\n\r\n**Note: There are known issues with Node.js v7 and webpack / webpack-dev-server. Please use Node.js v6 for the moment.**\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm install webpack-dev-server --save-dev\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Getting started\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to use it is with the CLI. In the directory where your `webpack.config.js` is, run:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnode_modules/.bin/webpack-dev-server\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will start a server, listening on connections from `localhost` on port `8080`.\r\n\r\nNow, when you change something in your assets, it should live-reload the files.\r\n\r\nSee [**the documentation**](http://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html) for more use cases and options.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nWe appreciate all help!
